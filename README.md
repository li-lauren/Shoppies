## Shoppies Nomination App 
#### Shopify UX Dev / Web Dev Intern Challenge 

Deployed At: https://the-shoppies-app.herokuapp.com/

##### Tech Stack 
React, Python (Flask), SqlAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap

##### Description
Shoppies is a single-page web app with a React front-end and Flask back-end, where 
users can nominate their favorite movies for the Shoppie awards.  

Additional features I implemented include user login and sign up (which is 
stored in a Postgres database) along with the ability to access nomination 
lists if the user leaves the page (via local storage). I also enjoyed diving deep into
the OMDB API discussions on Github to find a way to incorporate pre-fix matching when searching 
for titles.  This means that search results are not limited to exact matches
(e.g. searching "ram" would also return "Rambo", "Rambling" etc.) 

In the future, I plan to work on adding more CSS animations and incorporating
formal testing with React Testing Library.
